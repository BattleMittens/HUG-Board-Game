            <h1>"Super Epic Gamer Time"</h1>
            <p>The game is almost identical to the review game in class but it is revamped. The game's objective is still to own the most squares on the map, but it is much faster paced and more aggressive.
            After getting a correct question you will be assigned a certain amount of points which you can use to 
            advance or start your territory.
            There are opertunities to attack enemies which will only take up one point - this is encouraged.
            By taking away a space from an enemy and gaining your own you become much closer to DOMINATION!</p>
